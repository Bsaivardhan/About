                <h3>Myself</h3>
                <p>My self Im sai .I love travelling ..Travelling has been one of the biggest impact of my life.
                    It is the greatest adventure of my life and has made me learn priceless topics and has made me overcome many obstacles
                    Mostly, I have travelled with my Friends</p>

                <h3>Passion for travel</h3>
                <p>When I think about travel, my heart races with excitement. I feel a sense of freedom and adventure as I plan my next journey, whether 
                    it's to a bustling city, a remote village, or a pristine natural wonder.
                     The anticipation builds as I research the local customs, learn a few basic phrases in the language, and imagine the sights, sounds, 
                     and tastes that await me.Travel is an escape from the routine of everyday life. It's a chance to disconnect from the familiar and reconnect with the essence of being human. 
                    It broadens my perspective, challenges my assumptions, and teaches me valuable lessons about the world and myself.Ultimately, my passion for travel is about creating memories and collecting stories.
                     It's about stepping into the unknown and discovering that the world is both bigger and smaller than I could have ever imagined. 
                     </p>
